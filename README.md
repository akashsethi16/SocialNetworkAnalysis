# SocialNetworkAnalysis
A project of social network analysis where random data set is analysed and used to create network maps and graphs.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) – sometimes called Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) – is a set of
tools and processes for better understanding the relationships in a network. In social networks, the members
or nodes of the network are people and/or organizations and the links are the relationships between
these people and organizations. Using surveys and computer-aided analysis, SNA practitioners can
produce maps or pictures that display the patterns of connections between the nodes of the network. These
maps reveal characteristics of the network that help guide participants as they evaluate their network and
plan ways to improve their collective ability to identify and achieve shared goals.
SNA has exploded in popularity over the last few years to become not just a powerful leadership and
community development tool but also one of today’s hottest business consulting fads. As more and more
leadership and community network initiatives consider using SNA, we hope with our research to help make
it as easy as possible to recognize productive applications of SNA as well as situations where SNA will not
be helpful. This work builds on this bibliography of SNA for leadership development compiled by Claire
Reinelt (LLC Director of Research and Evaluation) and one of the authors.

PROJECT  OVERVIEW

We designed our project to increase our own knowledge of SNA and its application to leadership
networks and test the following two hypotheses;
• Visual network maps help the members of a community evaluate their own network—to see who is
really working with and learning from whom, who is in the core of network, who is on the
periphery, and who are the key boundary-spanners.
• Visual maps of community networks help plan better interventions to improve connections
within the network, and help individual participants to expand their circles of learning and
resource sharing.
